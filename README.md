Project Title
Hogwarts Adventure

Brief Description
Hogwarts Adventure is a text-based adventure game developed in Python. The project is inspired by the Harry Potter universe and was created as part of the TI101 – Programming in Python course. The game is divided into several chapters and takes place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The player creates a character, assigns attributes, is sorted into a house, learns spells, answers a magic quiz, and participates in a Quidditch match. The player’s choices influence both the character’s attributes and the number of points earned by their house.
